# avdl - Abstract video-game development language

## Summary

The idea of this language, is for the programmer to focus on describing the game itself,
without focusing on platform-specific implementations.

## Games made with this language

These are games made by me, using this language.
Their purpose were mainly to show what this language can do.

### Shuffled Nightmares

This is a small puzzle game, where the user is presented
with a shuffled puzzle, with the task to unshuffle it.
Once done, a "Nightmare" will be revealed in front of them.
The game has 12 stages and a random mode.

When making this I wanted to make sure the language
can initialise a game properly, draw 3D graphics,
including textures, handle input and play audio.

## Documentation

At some point I've started documenting how this language can be used,
but the language is still changing, which makes it difficult to
maintain its documentation as well.

Currently there is no up-to-date documentation, which makes it difficult
for others to use this language. Once it's shape becomes more stable,
I will update the documentation, with the intention to keep it
up-to-date with any new changes.
